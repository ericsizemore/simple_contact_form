<h2>What is SV's Simple Contact?</h2>
A rather simple PHP contact form script that can be integrated into an existing 
site/design, or be used standalone.

<h2>Installation</h2>
This script is designed to be integrated into an existing design or website. However,
the including 'contact.php' has its own HTML/etc to be run standalone.
<br /><br />
Simply upload the script and edit the '/sc_includes/sc_config.php' file. This file holds 
several important options, they should be self explanatory (they are commented).
